# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains machine learning projects that follow a complete data science workflow. Includes:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality by handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the dataset for unbiased and accurate results.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights into the data to understand key features, relationships, and patterns that inform model development.

Feature Engineering & Preparation: Applying techniques like feature scaling and SMOTE to balance imbalanced datasets and optimize input features for model performance.

Machine Learning Modeling: Implementing and evaluating various ML algorithms to solve real-world classification and prediction problems.

Each project demonstrates practical application of core machine learning concepts, with a focus on clean code, reproducibility, and interpretability.
